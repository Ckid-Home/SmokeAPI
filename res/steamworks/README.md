# Steamworks

Most of the SDK folders are extracted from the official valve sources.

However, the SDK folders that end with an `x`, `y`, or `z` contain `steam_api` binaries
that can no longer be found in official valve source. They have been extracted
from games that were using them. It's important to include them too, as they
might contain exports that have since been removed.
